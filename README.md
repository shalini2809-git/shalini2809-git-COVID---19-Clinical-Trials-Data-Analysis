#COVID-19 Clinical Trials Data Analysis
Description

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (Project_1.ipynb) for analyzing a COVID-19 clinical trials dataset. Using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, the notebook loads and previews data from COVID-19 clinical trials.csv, providing a foundation for exploring clinical trial details such as status, interventions, and outcomes. Ideal for researchers and data enthusiasts interested in COVID-19 clinical research trends.

Dataset

The dataset (COVID-19 clinical trials.csv) includes information on clinical trials related to COVID-19, with columns such as:





Rank: Trial rank



NCT Number: National Clinical Trial identifier



Title: Study title



Acronym: Study acronym



Status: Current status (e.g., Recruiting, Active, not recruiting)



Study Results: Availability of results



Conditions: Medical conditions studied



Interventions: Type of interventions



Outcome Measures: Primary outcomes



Sponsor/Collaborators: Organizations involved



Start Date, Completion Date, etc.: Key dates



Locations: Study locations



URL: ClinicalTrials.gov link

Note: The dataset is not included in this repository. Users must provide the COVID-19 clinical trials.csv file and place it in the appropriate directory (e.g., /content/) to run the notebook.

Requirements

To run the notebook, you need the following Python libraries:





pandas



matplotlib



seaborn



plotly

Installation





Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name



Set Up a Virtual Environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate



Install Dependencies:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly



Add the Dataset:





Obtain the COVID-19 clinical trials.csv file.



Place it in the /content/ directory or update the file_path variable in the notebook to point to the correct location.

Usage





Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

Open Project_1.ipynb in the Jupyter interface.



Run the Notebook:





Ensure the dataset file is accessible.



Execute the cells to install libraries, load the dataset, and preview the data using df.head().



Extend the notebook with additional analyses, such as visualizing trial statuses or mapping trial locations.



Extend the Analysis:





Add visualizations (e.g., bar plots for trial statuses using Seaborn or interactive maps with Plotly).



Analyze trends like trial start dates or intervention types.
